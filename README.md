## 🚀 About Me
I am a Software Developer deeply committed to solving real-world problems using **Machine Learning** and **Spatial Analytics**. Recently, I've been focusing on **Healthcare Efficiency**, building end-to-end pipelines that integrate public health data with high-resolution demographic indicators.

I believe that programming is a form of art—a blend of logic, data, and social impact.

## 📊 Featured Project: Healthcare Efficiency Analytics
**Predicting Hospital Cost Gaps in Paraná (Brazil)**
* **The Problem:** Identifying financial inefficiencies in chronic disease management (Diabetes/Hypertension).
* **The Solution:** An automated pipeline using `PySUS` and `Sidrapy` to fetch 2022 Census data, training a `RandomForest` model tracked by `MLflow`, and deploying a live inference dashboard via `Streamlit`.
* **Key Achievement:** Integrated diverse data sources to identify municipalities with >20% unexplained cost overruns through Residual Analysis.
